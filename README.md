# Adventures in Static Compilation with Julia
A few examples to test the waters with `StaticCompiler.jl`.

Starting small, I'm looking to build CLI executables and experiment with calling precompiled Julia code as a C library in other languages.


**Repo is a heavy WIP personal project. Still working through examples and thinking up use-cases :)**
